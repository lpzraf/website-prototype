  	<div id="box">
  		<p><strong>Hola! My name is Rafael Lopez, </strong></p><p id="fsizecolor">I'm an <strong>Arts & Cultural Marketer</strong> based in Brooklyn, NY. I grew up surfing and skating on the tropical paradise that is the Caribbean—a place filled with amazing artists and designers who have inspired me to develop a career where I can find the best methods of digital support for creatives in need. What I do is <strong>Digital Marketing</strong> with an interest in Design, Fashion and the Arts. My work is focused on increasing online visibility with a combination of <strong>SEO, Search and Paid Social ads leveraging the power of Digital Analytics</strong>. If you are an independent artist or DIY institution who doesn't know what to do to be easily found on the web, don’t let your work to be lost in the oceanic space of the internet. Drop me a line and I won't stop until people start discovering your work on the world wide web...btw, all for a trade or FREE!</p>
